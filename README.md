# Theory of Everything | [Huanyu Shi's Blog](https://huanyushi.github.io/) 

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the beautiful [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme. Thanks to the contributors for their work.

## Customization
Based on Chipy, I've made lots of customization, and I have blogged about these changes. You can see [Chirpy Blog Customization](https://huanyushi.github.io/posts/Chirpy-Blog-Customization/) to get more details (Note that it was written in Chinese).

What I have done:
- Modify the MathJax config file to load the physics package.
- Add a background image to the sidebar and modify the associated text styles.
- Add friend links in the sidebar (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions/1677)).
- Make Further Reading display the latest posts (see this [PR](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/pull/1699)).
- Add site statistics from 'buanzi'([不蒜子](https://busuanzi.ibruce.info/)) in the footer.
- Add background animation (refer to [@NichtsHsu](https://nihil.cc/)).
- Add 4 new colorboxes (see [here](https://huanyushi.github.io/posts/Chirpy-Blog-Customization/#8-%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A0-4-%E4%B8%AA%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84-colorbox)).

<table>
<tr>
   <th>Light</th>
   <th>Dark</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="assets/img/readme/colorbox-light.PNG" alt="colorbox-light"></td>
<td><img src="assets/img/readme/colorbox-dark.PNG" alt="colorbox-dark"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="assets/img/readme/colorbox-notitle-light.PNG" alt="colorbox-notitle-light"></td>
<td><img src="assets/img/readme/colorbox-notitle-dark.PNG" alt="colorbox-notitle-dark"></td>
</tr>
</table>

- Modified the style of the `details` element.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Close</th>
        <td><img src="assets/img/readme/details-close.PNG" alt="details-close"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Open</th>
        <td><img src="assets/img/readme/details-open.PNG" alt="details-open"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

- Python implementation for LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders) (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions/1685)).
- Python implementation for Inverted image.
