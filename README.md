# Theory of Everything | [Huanyu Shi's Blog](https://huanyushi.github.io/) 

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the beautiful [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme. Thanks to the contributors for their work.

## Customization
Based on Chipy, I've made lots of customization, and I have blogged about these changes. You can see [Chirpy Blog Customization](https://huanyushi.github.io/posts/Chirpy-Blog-Customization/) to get more details (Note that it was written in Chinese).

What I have done:
1. Modify the MathJax config file to load the physics package.
2. Add a background image to the sidebar and modify the associated text styles.
3. Add friend links in the sidebar (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions/1677)).
4. Make Further Reading display the latest posts (see this [PR](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/pull/1699)).
5. Add site statistics from 'buanzi'([不蒜子](https://busuanzi.ibruce.info/)) in the footer.
6. Add background animation (refer to [@NichtsHsu](https://nihil.cc/)).
7. Add 4 new colorboxes (see [here](https://huanyushi.github.io/posts/Chirpy-Blog-Customization/#7-增加背景动画)). 
8. Modified the style of the `<details>` element.
9. Python implementation for LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders) (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions/1685)).
10. Python implementation for Inverted image.
