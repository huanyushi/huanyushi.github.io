# Theory of Everything | [Huanyu Shi's Blog](https://huanyushi.github.io/) 

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the beautiful [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme. Thanks to the contributors for their work.

## Customization
Based on Chipy, I've made lots of customization, and I have blogged about these changes. You can see [Chirpy Blog Customization](https://huanyushi.github.io/posts/Chirpy-Blog-Customization/) to get more details (Note that it was written in Chinese).

What I have done:
- Modify the MathJax config file to load the physics package.
- Add a background image to the sidebar and modify the associated text styles.
- Add friend links in the sidebar (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions/1677)).
- <del>Make Further Reading display the latest posts (see this [PR](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/pull/1699)).</del> (This PR has been merged after Chirpy v6.5.5)
- Add site statistics from 'buanzi'([不蒜子](https://busuanzi.ibruce.info/)) in the footer.
- Add background animation (refer to [@NichtsHsu](https://nihil.cc/)).
- Add GitHub contribution graph (via [gh-contrib-graph](https://github.com/lengthylyova/gh-contrib-graph)).

- Add 4 new prompts (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions/1707)).

<table>

   <th>Light</th>
   <th>Dark</th>

<td><img src="assets/img/readme/colorbox-dark.PNG" alt="colorbox-dark"></td>
</tr>

</tr>
</table>

- Modified the style of the `details` element.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Close</th>
        <td><img src="assets/img/readme/details-close.PNG" alt="details-close"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Open</th>
        <td><img src="assets/img/readme/details-open.PNG" alt="details-open"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

- Python implementation for LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders) (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/discussions/1685)).
- Python implementation for Inverted image.
