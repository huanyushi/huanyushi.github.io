Since I wrote my first answer on Zhihu in the early morning of **August 27, 2021**, I have started to record what I have learned and gained on website.

There is a question on Zhihu, [why do some people answer a lot of professional questions on Zhihu for free?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/64355408) Some of the answers can represent my thoughts:
> Because no output, read more is useless.


Writing answers is actually a way to output knowledge.

This is one of the chapters of my personal notes, which captures my answers on some question-and-answer sites. 

And this post was first posted on [Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/501422450).
