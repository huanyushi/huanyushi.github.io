Hamiltonian  with interaction can not always be solved exactly, the first few orders of perturbation theory cannot provide an adequate description of an interacting many-particle system. So we must find other methods to obtain all orders in perturbation theory. Luckily, we can get a formal solution through **Green's functions**.

## Definition, symmetry and physical significance
The Green's function is defined as:

$$
G_{\alpha\beta}(\vb{x},\vb{x}';t,t') = -i \bra{\psi_{H}^{0}} \hat{\mathsf{T}}\qty[\hat{\psi}_{H\alpha}(\vb{x},t)\hat{\psi}_{H\beta}^\dagger(\vb{x}',t')]\ket{\psi_H^{0}},
$$

where $\hat{\mathsf{T}}$ is the time ordering operator.
